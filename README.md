# Star Realms Score

A Flutter app to keep score on the Star Realms deckbuilding game.

Star Realms is a two-player card game in which the score changes frequently. Each score board is facing one of the players during the game, for easier tracking.

A quick app I built in a day, with the intention of training state management and Flutter project structuring.
